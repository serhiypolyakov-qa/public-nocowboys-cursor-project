Do not modify, create, delete, or refactor any code automatically.

Before making any code changes:
- Explicitly describe what changes you propose
- List the files that will be affected
- Explain why these changes are needed

Wait for my explicit approval before applying any changes.
Only proceed after I clearly confirm approval.
